## Stack description 💻
Project has two parts - back-end on ASP.NET Core MVC and front-end on ReactJs library.
The first one has a 3tier architecture:

- DAL (Data access layer)
- BLL (Business logic layer)
- UI (Here it is API Controllers layer)

Registration and login are implemented by using JWT authentication.

Data is stored in the SQL Server database. EF6 was used to access the data.

Bootstrap was used in the front-end part.
